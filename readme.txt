Experience a hassle-free WordPress login experience with just one click.

Say goodbye to the frustration of remembering dashboard login credentials. No more tedious username/email & password entry every time you log in.

Login serves as the primary gateway to your website‚Äôs admin area. It is essential to make it secure and a seamless experience for users.
Creating a separate admin login for outsiders is always risky and time-consuming. This process is lengthy:

‚û°Ô∏è Go to the Users option.
‚û°Ô∏è Enter username and email address.
‚û°Ô∏è Select the user role as ‚ÄòAdministrator‚Äô
‚û°Ô∏è Save the changes or click ‚ÄòAdd New User‚Äô

So what if this entire process gets replaced using a simple process without creating a new username? Instant, automated, and in one click?
Using this plugin, you can create a self-expiring login link to grant temporary access to an individual (developer, support staff, or concerned person).

<strong>SHARE LOGIN ACCESS IN SECONDS! ‚è±Ô∏è</strong>

It takes just <strong>3 simple steps:</strong>

1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Create login link:</strong> After clicking on the ‚Äògenerate access ‚Äò button, it will generate a temporary login link within 1 second.

2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Take full control of the login:</strong> Going to setting option you can set validity period for the login link so this will automatically expire after the time lapses.

3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Share effortlessly:</strong> The login access is now conditional and will only be accessible based on the configured controls. Share the link with the concerned person.

That was pretty easy, right?
