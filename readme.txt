Experience a hassle-free WordPress login experience with just one click.

Say goodbye to the frustration of remembering dashboard login credentials. No more tedious username/email & password entry every time you log in.

Login serves as the primary gateway to your website’s admin area. It is essential to make it secure and a seamless experience for users.
Creating a separate admin login for outsiders is always risky and time-consuming. This process is lengthy:

➡️ Go to the Users option.
➡️ Enter username and email address.
➡️ Select the user role as ‘Administrator’
➡️ Save the changes or click ‘Add New User’

So what if this entire process gets replaced using a simple process without creating a new username? Instant, automated, and in one click?
Using this plugin, you can create a self-expiring login link to grant temporary access to an individual (developer, support staff, or concerned person).

<strong>SHARE LOGIN ACCESS IN SECONDS! ⏱️</strong>

It takes just <strong>3 simple steps:</strong>

1️⃣ <strong>Create login link:</strong> After clicking on the ‘generate access ‘ button, it will generate a temporary login link within 1 second.

2️⃣ <strong>Take full control of the login:</strong> Going to setting option you can set validity period for the login link so this will automatically expire after the time lapses.

3️⃣ <strong>Share effortlessly:</strong> The login access is now conditional and will only be accessible based on the configured controls. Share the link with the concerned person.

That was pretty easy, right?

When it comes to dashboard login access, it is securely stored in an encrypted format within the browser extension using an industry-standard JWT token. The generated token cannot be compressed to encrypt login credentials.
